/** Does a simple and somewhat efficient depth-first search of all FlowNodes in the DAG.
 *
 *  <p>Iteration order: depth-first search, revisiting parallel branches once done.
 *
 * <p> The behavior is analogous to {@link org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.graph.FlowGraphWalker} but faster.
 *  With parallel branches, the last branch is explored, then remaining branches are explored in reverse order.
 *  This keeps ordering compatibility with FlowGraphWalker.
