/**
 * Scans through the flow graph in strictly linear fashion, visiting only the first branch in parallel blocks.
 *
 * <p/>Iteration order: depth-ONLY, meaning we walk through parents and only follow the first parent of each {@link FlowNode}
 * This means that where are parallel branches, we will only visit a partial set of {@link FlowNode}s in the directed acyclic graph.
 *
 * <p/>Use case: we don't care about parallel branches or know they don't exist, we just want to walk through the top-level blocks.
 *
 * <p/>This is the fastest & simplest way to walk a flow, because you only care about a single node at a time.
