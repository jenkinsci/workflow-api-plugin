/**
 * This visitor's callbacks are invoked as we walk through a pipeline flow graph, and it splits it into chunks.
 * <p> A {@link ForkScanner#visitSimpleChunks(SimpleChunkVisitor, ChunkFinder)} creates these FlowChunks using a {@link ChunkFinder} to define the chunk boundaries.
 *
 * <p>We walk through the {@link FlowNode}s in reverse order from end to start, so <em>end callbacks are invoked before
 *  their corresponding start callbacks.</em>
 *
 * <p><em>Callback types</em>
 * <p> There are two kinds of callbacks - chunk callbacks, and parallel structure callbacks
 * <p><em>Chunk Callbacks:</em>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #chunkStart(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)} - detected the start of a chunk beginning with a node</li>
 *     <li>{@link #chunkEnd(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)} - detected the end of a chunk, terminating with a node </li>
 *     <li>{@link #atomNode(FlowNode, FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)} - most nodes, which aren't boundaries of chunks</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><p><em>Chunk callback rules:</em>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>For a single node, it may have EITHER OR BOTH chunkStart and chunkEnd events</li>
 *     <li>Every node that doesn't get a startChunk/endChunk callback gets an atomNode callback.</li>
 *     <li>For {@link ChunkFinder} implementations that match the {@link BlockStartNode} and {@link BlockEndNode} should never have both for a single</li>
 *     <li>You cannot have multiple of any of the same specific type of callbacks for the same flownode</li>
 *     <li>You cannot have a atomNode callback AND a start/end for the same flownode (application of the above).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Parallel Structure Callbacks: Zero, One, or Multiple may be invoked for any given FlowNode</p>
 * <p>These are used to provide awareness of parallel/branching structures if they need special handling
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #parallelStart(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #parallelEnd(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #parallelBranchStart(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #parallelBranchEnd(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementations get to decide how to use and handle chunks, and should be stateful.
 * <p><h3>At a minimum they should handle:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Cases where there is no enclosing chunk (no start/end found, or outside a chunk)</li>
 *     <li>Cases where there is no chunk end to match the start, because we haven't finished running a block</li>
 *     <li>Nesting of chunks</li>
 * </ul>
