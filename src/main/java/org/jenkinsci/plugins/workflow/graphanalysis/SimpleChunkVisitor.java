/**
 * This visitor's callbacks are invoked as we walk through a pipeline flow graph, and it splits it into chunks.
 * <p/> A {@link ForkScanner#visitSimpleChunks(SimpleChunkVisitor, ChunkFinder)} creates these FlowChunks using a {@link ChunkFinder} to define the chunk boundaries.
 *
 * <p/> Implementations get to decide how to use & handle chunks.
 * <p/> <h3>At a minimum they should handle:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Unbalanced numbers of chunk start/end calls (for incomplete flows)</li>
 *     <li>A chunk end with no beginning (runs to start of flow, or never began)</li>
 *     <li>A chunk start with no end (ex: a block that hasn't completed running)</li>
 *     <li>Other starts/ends before we hit the closing one (nesting)</li>
 *     <li>Atom nodes not within the current Chunk (visitor is responsible for handling state)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <em>Important implementation note: multiple callbacks can be invoked for a single node depending on its type.</em
 * <p/>For example, we may capture parallels as chunks.
 *
 * <p/><h3>Callbacks Reporting on chunk/parallel information:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #chunkStart(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)} is called on the current node when we hit start of a boundary (inclusive) </li>
 *     <li>{@link #chunkEnd(FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)} is called when we hit end of a boundary (inclusive)</li>
 *     <li>{@link #atomNode(FlowNode, FlowNode, FlowNode, ForkScanner)} called when a node is neither start nor end.</li>
 *     <li>All the parallel methods are used to report on parallel status - helpful when we need to deal with parallels internal to chunks.</li>
 * </ul>
