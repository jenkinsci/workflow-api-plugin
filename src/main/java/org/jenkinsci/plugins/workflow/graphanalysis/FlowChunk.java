/**
 * Common container interface for a series of {@link FlowNode}s with a logical start and end.
 * <p/><p/> We use this because every plugin has a different way of storing info about the nodes.
 *
 * <p/> Common uses:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A single FlowNode (when coupling with timing/status APIs)</li>
 *     <li>A block (with a {@link org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.graph.BlockStartNode} and {@link org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.graph.BlockEndNode})</li>
 *     <li>A linear run of marked nodes (such as a legacy stage)</li>
 *     <li>A parallel block (special case of block)</li>
 *     <li>A parallel branch within a parallel block</li>
 *     <li>A mix of types in sequence, such as nested structures</li>
 * </ul>
